# Sales Trend Analysis - Task 6

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Analyze monthly revenue and order volume from the `online_sales_sample` dataset using SQL aggregations in PostgreSQL.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin 4

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
`online_sales_sample.csv` â€” contains order details such as:
- `order_date`
- `order_id`
- `amount`
- `product_id`
- `year` & `month` (present in CSV but not used directly â€” derived from `order_date`)

## ðŸ“Š Queries Performed
1. **Monthly Revenue & Volume**  
   - Extracted year and month from `order_date` using `EXTRACT()`.  
   - Grouped data by year and month.  
   - Calculated monthly revenue using `SUM(amount)`.  
   - Calculated order volume using `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`.  
   - Ordered results chronologically.

2. **Filter for a Specific Year**  
   - Applied `WHERE` condition to analyze only 2023 data.  
   - Sorted months by highest revenue.  

3. **Top 3 Months by Revenue**  
   - Grouped by year and month.  
   - Calculated total revenue per month.  
   - Sorted in descending order and limited results to top 3 months.

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights
- Identified month-wise sales performance.
- Pinpointed peak months by revenue.
- Learned use of aggregate functions, grouping, filtering, and ordering.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Import `online_sales_sample.csv` into PostgreSQL.
2. Open `task6_sales_trend.sql` in pgAdmin or `psql`.
3. Run the queries sequentially.
4. View results to analyze sales trends.
